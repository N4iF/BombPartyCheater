# Word Finder Script

This Python script allows users to find words from a dictionary that contain specific letters. It can be particularly useful for word games or puzzles where you need to find words based on a few given letters.
For example BombParty, jklm.fun
## Usage

1. **Input**: Run the script and enter the letters you want to search for. You can also type "exit" to exit the script.

   ```
   Enter the letters or write (exit): oo
   ```

2. **Output**: The script will display words containing the specified letters. Additionally, it selects a random word from the matching words and copies it to your clipboard.

   ```
   Words containing 'oo':
   door
   moon
   good

   We get a random choice for you: 'moon' - it has been copied to the clipboard
   ```

3. **Exit**: To exit the script, simply type "exit".

   ```
   Enter the letters or write (exit): exit
